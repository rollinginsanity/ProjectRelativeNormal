# ProjectRelativeNormal
## What is this?

Well, first of all, the name is from my [random name generator](https://github.com/rollinginsanity/randomator) randomator. It doesn't actually have anything to do with the content, it's just a working title.

Secondly, check out the branches, there won't be anything in the main branch for a while, but draft chapters and plot skeletons will show up in the other branches.

## Why am I doing this?

Well, being a user of the internet, there is a 99.999% chance this will never be found, or read (not the worst thing).

I needed somewhere to stick some writing, and I wanted to do it in a different way, so here goes.

## How do the branches work?

Bearing in mind I'm writing this before I actually start writing in anger, something like:

* Skeleton - the initial rough paragraph summaries of each scene.
* Rough - as chapters start to get fleshed out, they go gere.
* Draft - as they reach their final length, chapeters probably go here. Don't expect them to be close to perfect though, there will be consistencies.
* Final draft - the final draft of a chapter. Pretty much in its final form, minus proper proof reading.
* Beta - After a chapter is proof read, it goes here. Just because it's in beta doesn't mean I won't throw it away.
* Master - The final state, hopefully. 

## Folders

The chapters will be in the `book` directory, each chapter will have one or more scenes.

There will also be a folder with higher level background and character info. I can't make any promises, but hopefully the background info also gets more concrete.

## What's the plot?

Read, and find out :)
