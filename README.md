# ProjectRelativeNormal
## What is this?

Well, first of all, the name is from my [random name generator](https://github.com/rollinginsanity/randomator) randomator. It doesn't actually have anything to do with the content, it's just a working title.

Secondly, check out the branches, there won't be anything in the main branch for a while, but draft chapters and plot skeletons will show up in the other branches.

## Why am I doing this?

Well, being a user of the internet, there is a 99.999% chance this will never be found, or read (not the worst thing).

I needed somewhere to stick some writing, and I wanted to do it in a different way, so here goes.

## What's the plot?

Read, and find out :)
