Jack is regretting his choice to turn the others in. He has been given freedom, but doesn't like the cost. Kate talks to him, tells him that he was on the right side all along, and that Kate had been covering for the trio as well as she could, keeping them off the radar, as she had promised Aarna. Burke arrivers, mentions they are leaving soon, and hands Jack the keys to one of the trio's motorbike. He tells Jack that he has a chance to redeem himself, and that the BlueCrew encampment isn't far. Burke also says he'll cover for Jack, and that he should stay behind and wait until the group has gone.
