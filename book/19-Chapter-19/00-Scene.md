Aarna is in a prison truck. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. Aarna contemplates her fate, and wonders why she wasn't just killed. The convoy stops, and the doors are busted open. Jack is there. He pulls her out and hands her a gun (given she has one good arm.) The bluecrew have arrived and are fighting the MetSec forces. Burke and his crew are bugging out. Kate is also taking out MetSec forces while helping Ryan (still injured) to cover. They fight until MetSec decides to leave with the remaining troops. Mandrell is incensed. At the end Aarna passes out.
