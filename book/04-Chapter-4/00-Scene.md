The three walk in to the Doctor's shop, planning on kidnapping him. He recognises Aarna (from the news) and instead of panicking, offers to help. The plan changes from kidnapping to askng for help. The doctor takes a look at Aarna's arm and her Cybernetic Interfaces, and then says the problem is related to stress, and the cocktail of drugs she is on. He gives her a specific sort of stimulant, and tells her to only take it when it is required. The three leave the doctor's and make plans to head to another slum area further south, but run into more MetSec officers sweeping the area. Another running battle ensues, with the trio running in to a drainage canal, and then in to an underground stormwater complex.
