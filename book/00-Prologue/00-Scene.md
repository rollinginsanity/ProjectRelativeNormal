A dirty concrete wall, mottled with age, created a stark backdrop to the perfect white the figure was wearing.\
"But I found them. There were patterns, inconsistencies. See, the mistake _you_ made was that everyone was too distracted with their own problems." The figure leant forward in their chair, uncrossing their legs as they did so. "Secrecy by obscurity is a lie, I found you." Pictures flashed in front of the white figure, each showing a face. The faces of politicians. Each face was only shown for a fraction of a second, not long enough to figure out who they were.\
"You tried to break the world, you tried to break justice, you did this for your own ends." The figure stood with slow intent. "I saw what you did, and I'm coming for you."
