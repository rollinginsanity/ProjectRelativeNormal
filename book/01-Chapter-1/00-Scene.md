## Chapter 1

"Is that better?" asked Ryan. He leant back, removing the adjustment tool from the inner components of Aarna's left cybernetic arm.\
Aarna tried moving the arm, components whirring. "I don't think so," she replied.\
Ryan sighed. "We've been at this for hours now, I've looked at every possibility for the lag, I'm not sure what it could be."\
Aarna stood up and walked accross the dilapidated apartment to the window, rotating her arm as she did so. "Maybe it's just the stress," she replied. "It's not unheard of," she continued as she looked out the window to the street below. There were some kids out playing and a few of the peddlers had come out to try and hock their wares, not the rain had gone.\
"But the other arm, both legs and all those other random bits and pieces floating around inside you are fine? I'm just saying it's odd is all," said Ryan, packing away the tools he had been using to fix Aarna's arm.\
Aarna pulled a box from her pocket and pulled out a cigarette. The things were illegal these days, but out in the slums plenty of back-alley manufacturers packed whatever they thought would sell in to a pack of cigarettes and sold them to whoever was buying.\
Ryan thought Aarna struck an imposing presence as she stood by the window. The war hadn't been easy on her, it was plain to see at this moment. She was only in shorts and a tshirt, her usual when the pair were servicing her cybernetics. She had no original limbs left. Both arms and both legs had been lost, the left arm the most recently in a gunfight with MetSec. A shredder round, designed to pulp a target, had hit it, but given she was on the run, getting a hold of a decent replacement for her last human limb hadn't been easy, and she'd had to go with an older model.\
"I still don't get why you smoke, the air-exchange module you have would just filter out the toxins," said Ryan, closing the latch on the tool kit. Unlike Aarna, he only had a cybernetic right hand, which had never given him issues.\
"Yeah, it's just habit nowdays," replied Aarna, breathing a stream of smoke out of her mouth with the words.\
Ryan moved over to the window next to her and took the cigarette out of her hand and took a long drag on it before handing it back.\
"Smooth," he said before blowing it out, his eyebrows forming a pained frown.\
"I'd like to move on soon," said Aarna after a short silence, "We've been here almost a week, and I don't imagine they've stopped looking for the three rouge BSO agents yet."\
"Kill one politician..." replied Ryan, letting the sentence fall away. "Things are good here, there's been no sign of a MetSec investigation, and none of our contacts have reported any intel that they know we're here." Ryan caught Aarna's gaze and returned it. "We're _safe_ here, Soot," he added, using the Nickname he had called Aarna ever since they served in the war.\
Aarna sighed, "Maybe you're right."
Ryan headed back to finish cleaning the table, and Aarna continued to look out the window, maybe the running could be over. It had been months of hideouts, sleeping in drains and just evading MetSec since they had publically and violently killed one of the most corrupt politicians that the city had ever seen.\
The intent wasn't for the killing to be public, but no plan ever survives a first encounter, as a commanding officer had once told her.\
Aarna was broken from her thoughts by the sound of feet in the hallway outside, a soft beep and the door unlocking, followed by Jack, the third in their group of outlaws.\
"Guys," he said, "We've got to go, MetSec knows."
