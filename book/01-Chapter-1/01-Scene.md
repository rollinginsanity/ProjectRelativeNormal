## Chapter 1 - 

Kyle Mandrell practically kicked the door down as he entered the office of the Chief of the MetSec Special Investigations Bureau, Sub-Commissioner Hendricks
"Captain Mandrell, to what to I owe the pleasure?" said the Sub-Commisioner. The man was in his late 50's and had soft features. He was also not a fan of Mandrell, who at thirty-one was one of the youngest captains on the force. The man had so much upwards velocity that Hendricks' was surprised he hadn't hit orbit yet.\
"We've got a lead on Aarna Vash, one of her accomplaces was spotted in Kensington," he said, in a rush.\
"And?" replied Hendricks. Hendricks was of the opinion that Aarna had done the city a service, and wasn't interested in putting too much effort in to catching Aarna Vash, Ryan Nzama or Jack Briar any more.\
"And we tracked their location. I have ordered MetSec officers to search the slums nearby Kensington.\
Hendricks sighed, "And whose authorisation did you seek before ordering _beat cops_ around?" he asked. "We're the Speicial Bureau, you know we don't have that authority. I'm probably going to have to explain this at the next leadership-team meeting."\
Mandrell's eyes went from excited to menacing in an instant. Hendricks got the feeling that he had just got in the way of the younger man's ambitions.\
"Oh you don't need to worry about that _sir_," said Mandrell, with extra emphasis on the last word. "The Minister of Justice gave me the authority to take command of those MetSec officers. The capture of Aarna Vash and her accompaces are of great importance to the minister."\
_Shit_, thought Hendricks. He was sure the Minister of Justice was just as corrupt as the politician killed by the trio. Not a man to get involved with.\
"What do you need?" asked Hendricks, putting his best stepford smile on.\
