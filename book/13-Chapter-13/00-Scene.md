Mandrell and crew rock up at the MetSec substation in the town. He rips in to the local commander, and views surveillance tapes. He sees Ryan breaking in to the Agri-Transport hub, and is enraged that he wasn't captured, and an alarm wasn't raised. He talks about a compromise of the operations here (which Burke and Kate aren't aware of.) He orders the local commander arrested by his men. On the way out he quietly orders the man shot.
