The three finish packing and eating their bacon sandwiches, but take too long. The street has MetSec officers going door-to-door. The trio decide to head down a few floors to where they can get on to the roof of the next building. They just barely make it accross, and just avoid getting seen by MetSec. They make it on to the street, but then just as they are almost clear, and officer runs up to ask if they have seen anybody suspicious. This turns in to a gun fight. They have a battle, and then the trio escape. They see Mandrell arrive in an air-transport just before they manage to escape.
