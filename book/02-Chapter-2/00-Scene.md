## Chapter 2 - 

Aarna indelicatly held what was left of her bacon sandwich in her mouth as she packed. They had acquired a fair amount of stuff while they stayed here and they had planned to make an organised move, so she had to choose what came with her and what would get left behind.\
"Handguns or SMG's**" shouted Ryan from one of the rooms where they had hidden their weapons stash.\
Aarna shoved the pair of pants in her hand into the bag she was packing. "Why not both?" she replied.\
"Fair call, usually I would agree with you, but in this case I would highlight that they both use the same ammunition," replied Ryan."
Aarna sighed. SMGs were great, but they would piss through ammo anyway, "handguns, and remember to put SMGs _with_ a different ammo calibre on the shopping list."\
"Uh guys, not to rush you or anything, but things are getting _real_ bad down on the street," chimed in Jack, who was already packed and looking out the window. To add weight to his words a couple of gunshots cracked and echoed. Aarna dropped what she was doing and joined Jack at the window.\
It wasn't pretty, gone was the pleasant street scene, instead MetSec officers were now everywhere, corralling the people that were on the street in to groups, hands on heads. A couple more gunshots could be heard, and Aarna flinched when she saw what MetSec had been shooting, a couple of what looked to be boys had tried to run. One was on the ground, holding his leg and writhing in agony, the other was flat on his stomach, unmoving. It sent a chill down her spine.\
"Shit, shit, they're not just sending in a squad to flush us out, it's a god damn fucking raid!" panicked Jack. "We gotta, we... we gotta go!"\
"Ryan!" Aarna said, "We can't leave this building via the street, too many guards outside."\
Ryan slung his bag over his back and threw a pistol to Aarna, "Well, I see two options. One, we shoot our way out."\
"I'm not liking option one a whole lot, what else?" replied Aarna.\
"We go down three floors, on to the roof of the next building. It's got a fire escape, down to the street there, blend in with the crowd and get the hell out of here." he continued.\
"Aint no chance that we're blending in with a crowd," said Jack. Aarna felt for him, he had been dragged in to Ryan and Aarna's actions accidentally, he hadn't had a whole lot of experience as a BSO agent, and wasn't used to dealing with combat pressure.\
"Okay, maybe we'll have to shoot our way out a bit," said Aarna, checking the pistol was loaded.\
Aarna grabbed her bag and slung it over her shoulder. Ryan placed a small device on the kitchen table and pressed a few buttons. "Five minutes," he said cryptically.\
"Perfect, let's move," replied Aarna, smiling.
The thee left the dingy apartment and headed to the stairwell. They heard the harsh sound of MetSec radio's echoing up. They were already in the building.\
"Quickly," whispered Ryan.\
The three moved down the stairs with quiet grace, but like all desperate situations, something small went wrong. Ryan had misjudged a step and tripped, catching himself against a wall.\
There was silence.\
"There's someone upstairs," came the voice of one of the soldiers.\
"Go, go, go," Aarna whispered loudly, ushering Jack and Ryan through the stairwell door in to another hallway. Abandonning the pretense of stealth the three started to run. There was a window at the end of the hall, floor-to-ceiling. Outside the roof of the next building was visible. Aarna tried to remeber how big the gap was.\
"Get ready to jump!" she shouted back at the others. She loocked for something to break the window with and saw a chair in the hall, obviously discarded because it was broken. A curious citizen opened their apartment door, "get back inside!" shouted Aarna, as she picked up the chair.\
Without a second thought she used her cybernetic strength to throw the chair through the window, took a few steps back and took a running jump.\
