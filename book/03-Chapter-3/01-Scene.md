Mandrell doesn't take the news well, and is angry that the three outlaws got away. He walks in to a pre-arranged meeting with Kate Dalian, who used to work with Aarna at the BSO. The plan had been to get an idea of how to interrogate Aarna, but instead recruits her in to his taskforce. 

Aarna, Kate and Jack are catching their breath and waiting for a street doctor to come back to his shop, where they are planning on arriving, kidnapping him, having him take a look at Aarna's arm, and then running off. They are talking, and the conversation turns to how they were found. Jack admits he must have been seen by a MetSec officer. He's a but cagy, not wanting to admit he nearly turned himself in. Aarna and Ryan admonish him, and tell him to be more careful. The doctor appears, and they approach.
