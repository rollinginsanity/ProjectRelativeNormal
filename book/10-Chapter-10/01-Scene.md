The trio are at a small town, resting after a long ride. They're cold, and have lit a fire. It's near the evening as well. A van arrives and several members of the BlueCrew exit, with their leader. Ryan begins to ask for Sanctuary, and the leader waves him off. They don't need the trouble. They do give the trio some supplies, and three old motorbikes so they have a chance of escaping.
