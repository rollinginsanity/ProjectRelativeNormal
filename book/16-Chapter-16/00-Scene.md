Aarna, ryan and jack are lying low, Ryan is recovering. They hear the distant sound of vehicles, but it's too late and they are surrounded. The three surrender without fighting. Mandrell proceeds to lecture the three. Aarna gives him attitude, and he starts on at her, which causes her stress levels to rise and her left (bad) arm to start twitching. Mandrell flies in to a range, and starts beating Aarna. In the process he rips her bad arm out and beats her with it for a while. He is stopped by Burke, who comes running in. Mandrell stalks off.
