The three break in to Parliament, sneak through, take out some guards, but suprisingly enough they run in to Burke and some of his men, which let them pass, and tell them they will stop pursuers. They enter parliament in their masks and begin their lecture. Near the end Rupert Maelstop appears and thanks the three for their work, and that for now, it is done. Burke comes back in and escorts them out.
