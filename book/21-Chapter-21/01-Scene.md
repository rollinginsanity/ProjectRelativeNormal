The BlueCrew help the team get in to an agtrain and back towards the city. Kate calls in a rescue, claiming she was captured by BlueCrew but escaped. Her plan is to get back in to the BSO in order to help the team. Her goal is to hide them from the surveillance system (with an exploit the BlueCrew gave her), and steal the bits for the Invisible, the masquerade they start using to ferment rebellion.
