Aarna wakes up in a makeshift hospital. It's well kitted out, and she is not sure where she is until the BlueCrew leader walks in. They talk, he helps Aarna understand that because she is broken and can't make herself whole, she is taking it out on the world, and that she needs to accept who she is before she can change the world. He then tells her that she should go back to the city and end this. He tells her she will get a replacement arm, not military grade, but better than what she had.
